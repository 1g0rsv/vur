Overview
This Go program offers a straightforward server with two primary features:

Encrypt and Save Text: Accepts user text input, encrypts it using AES, and stores it in a MySQL database. Each text entry is uniquely identified by a UUID.
Retrieve and Decrypt Text: Enables the retrieval of stored text using its UUID, decrypts it, and returns it to the user.
Key Features
AES Encryption: Implements AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for secure text encryption.
UUID Identification: Associates each text snippet with a unique UUID.
HTTP Server: Operates on port 8080, handling HTTP requests with Go's net/http package.
CORS Compatibility: Supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for interaction with web applications hosted on different domains.
MySQL Database Usage: Utilizes MySQL for storing encrypted texts, demonstrating insert and query operations.
Robust Error Handling: Handles various errors, including database, encryption/decryption, and invalid HTTP requests.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Go (Golang)
Encryption Library: Go's crypto/aes and crypto/cipher for AES encryption
Database: MySQL
Web Server: Go's net/http package
Database Driver: github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql for MySQL integration
UUID Generation: github.com/google/uuid for generating unique identifiers
Other Libraries: Standard Go libraries like crypto/rand, encoding/hex, log, etc.
Ideal Use Case
This program is ideal for applications that need basic text encryption and storage with a simple HTTP interface. It demonstrates essential concepts in web server operation, encryption, and database interaction in Go.
